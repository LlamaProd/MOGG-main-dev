[NAME:Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Core]
[DESCRIPTION:This is the core module for MOGG. This mod fixes a few oversights in vanilla DF that I consider to be bugs rather than features. The most major change is that the milking rate for all animals is no longer at a fixed 20000 ticks and has been calculated to reasonably reflect the amount of milk you can get from vanilla milkable creatures based on size/grazing requirements and the historical breeding of different species for milk production.

Cavies and rabbits have both been used for meat production throughout history so this also fixes them only dropping skulls when butchered. The pet value of picking them on embark has been very slightly increased to reflect this. The final significant bug-fix is to stop animal men creatures being milkable. Their dairy products would occasionally show up on embark and with trade caravans, even though there is no way for the player to milk them, as they all have the intelligent tag.

As for non-bug related changes, all creatures now have accurate names for their general creature name, gendered names and juvenile names. I have also taken the liberty of adding up to four preferences that dwarves and other entities can like about any creature that was lacking this many (they won't always like cows for their haunting moos now for instance). My most controversial change, might be renaming one humped and two-humped camels to their respective real world names, as bactrian camel's have a real world place name. The one other exception in the game I am aware of is guineafowl, and for this reason I decided to add another exception.

Finally I also added the words, "mammals", "gluttony", "milk/milky" and "cheesy" into the game's language files for all main civilisations. This is probably the most arbitrary change to vanilla DF but other than this I have tried to keep this core module as vanilla as possible. The reason this is "MOGG - Core" is because I have completely rewritten my old mods of the same name and redesigned them in this manner to be as modular, compatible and easily updated as possible based on what I have learned about modding DF so far. 

MOGG core should be fine for anyone who would just like the bug fixes mentioned above with as little interference with vanilla DF as possible but is really the foundation for my MOGG - Dairy update, which changes a lot of things that might clash with the purity of vanilla DF. I hope you enjoy whatever combinations of my mods you choose to use. I have already failed at brevity in my description but I will post some more detailed technical info in the steam mod discussions/forums for anyone who might be interested.
